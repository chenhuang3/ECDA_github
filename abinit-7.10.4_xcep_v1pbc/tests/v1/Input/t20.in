#%% description = 
#%%   Isolated Helium atom (see above). Treated with the exchange-only part of PBE (ixc=12).
#%%   For speed-up, it begins with the wavefunctions from test 11.
#%%   21.-25. Isolated Hydrogen atom tests.
#%%   These tests exercise different xc functionals, in the spin-polarized case.
#%%   The hydrogen atom is isolated in a box of size 7x7x7, with one
#%%   special point (1/4 1/4 1/4), 70 Ha cut-off, used with
#%%   a potential close to the bare H potential
#%%   (erfc with 0.005 bohr decay length). Errors due to the smallness
#%%   of the supercell size are on the order of 1 mHa, as well as those
#%%   due to finiteness of the basis set.
#%%   The estimation of the latter errors is presented in the test_cases 22 and 23.
#%%   Those due to the representation of the Coulomb potential by a erfc function
#%%   are much smaller. Except for test 24, intxc=0.
