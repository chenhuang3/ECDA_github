#%% O2 molecule, treated as a spin-polarized molecule, with fixed occupation
#%% numbers (occopt=2), with nsppol=2 . Gives total energy of -32.09792 Hartree
#%% 10.-20. Isolated Helium atom tests.
#%% These tests exercise different xc functionals, in the spin-unpolarized case.
#%% The helium atom is isolated in a box of size 5x5x5, with one
#%% special point (1/4 1/4 1/4), 200 Ha cut-off, used with 
#%% a potential close to the bare He potential 
#%% (erfc with 0.001 bohr decay length). Errors due to the smallness
#%% of the supercell size are on the order of 1 mHa, as well as those
#%% due to the representation of the Coulomb potential by a erfc function.
#%% The remaining is due to finiteness of the basis set.
#%% The estimation of the latter errors is presented in the test_cases
#%% 17 and 18. In all these tests, intxc=0.
