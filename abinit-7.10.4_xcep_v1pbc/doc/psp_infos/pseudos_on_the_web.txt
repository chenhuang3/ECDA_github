Concerning the PAW database on Abinit web site.
-----------------------------------------------

If you want to post new PAW atomic datasets, the modifications are the
following:

* The "CONTRIB" table (where you have to put the datasets) is now located at:
http://www.abinit.org/downloads/PAW2/TABLES/CONTRIB/
Then you have the different directories, one per atomic specie.

Once you have put your new dataset in CONTRIB, you have to add it in the
"index.html" file corresponding to the atomic species.
You can find it at:
http://www.abinit.org/downloads/PAW2/ATOMICDATA/xxx-specie/index.html
Put the link to your dataset in the third section (contributed PAW datasets).

I have generated all these index.html files using a script; but this is no
more possible through plone interface.

Last modification, if needed: the change of the color in the periodic table.
The picture of the table is located at:
