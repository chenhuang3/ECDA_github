The ABINIT GUI is under active development.
For practical purposes, and given the size of the packages 
(altogether, more than 60 MB as of August 2013), 
it has been decided not to deliver it with the main ABINIT package.
Please, find below the adequate links ...

------------------------------------------------
WHERE TO FIND SOURCES AND BINARIES ?
------------------------------------------------

The AbinitGUI sources are hosted by GitHUB and the repository of the last stable version can be downloaded using the following link:

https://github.com/abinitgui/abinitgui.git

------------------------------------------------

The AbinitGUI binaries (but also sources) of the last stable version as well as additional material can be found elsewhere:

http://flavio.be/AbinitGUI.php

There you can download the pseudo-potential filetree organized for AbinitGUI (PSP.zip) and other external post-processing libraries adapted for AbinitGUI (abipy.tar.gz & pymatgen.tar.gz).
