HOWTO to obtain a standalone libPAW library from ABINIT sources
=====
Just type 'make dist' (or simply 'make') in the present directory

Other commands:
 make clean: clean all libPAW files (source file directory & tarball)
 make libpaw: build the libPAW source file directory
 make libpaw-tarball: create the tarball from the libPAW source file directory

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then you get a tarball containing the libPAW library;
you can use it as explained below:
