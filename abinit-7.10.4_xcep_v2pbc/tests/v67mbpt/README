This directory, v67mbpt, contains tests which
are related to the development of the Many-Body Perturbation Theory in
version 6.x.x  and 7.x.x.of Abinit

Please, see the README file in the tests directory (above this one) to get help.


------------------------------------------------------------------

* Tests 01-10 are for GW calculations (screening and sigma part)

* Tests 11-20 concern the Bethe-Salpeter solver
    even if they contain an initial preparatory GW run.
    This trick allows one to define a subtarget "make tests_bse" that can be used
    to test the Bethe-Salpeter code without having to run the entire suite of GW tests.
    Note that "make tests_gw" requires tests_bse.

* Tests beyond 20 shoud follow a classification that has not yet been established.
