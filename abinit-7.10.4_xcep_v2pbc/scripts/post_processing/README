=====================

- AbinitBandStructureMaker.py
    Plot a band structure from an output file.

- ab_extended_scissors_guess.py
    Get the eigenvalues from an abinit _EIG.nc netcdf file. 

- abinit_eignc_to_bandstructure.py
    Plot the bandstructure from _EIG.nc file.

- dynamic_pol.f
    Compute the frequency-dependent polarisability from the TDDFT output.

- get_irreps.py
    Find the irreducible representation to which the Gamma phonons belong.

- matLab_data_analysis/
    Various scripts for MaLab treatment of the output.

- phondisp2abi.py
    Calculate frozen phonon frequencies, free energies, etc...

- plot_bandstructure.py
    Plot the bandstructure from _EIG.nc file.

- plot_bs.py
    Plot the electronic bandstructure, the zero-point motion renormalization and the broadening from a
    _EP.nc file.

- rf_mods.py
    Module conting the classes required by the "temperature_para.py" and "plot_bs.py" scripts

- temperature_para.py
    Compute the temperature dependence, zero-point motion renormalization and broadening 
    from _EIGR2D.nc and _EIGI2D.nc files. This script produce a _EP.nc file that can be later used.
