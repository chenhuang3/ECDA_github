==============================================================================
Use the script  runtests.py  for a flexible use of the test suite.
To get help, issue                   ./runtests.py --help | more

To run the new test suite inside a tmp directory (e.g. ~abinit/tmp/tests) :
../../tests/runtests.py
this will create a directory tmp/tests/Test_suite
Useful option when using manually the test suite : "-t0"
   (which disable the timeout routine)

Keywords to use with the make command for test directory (automated sets of tests) :

check_local    Standard set of tests, used on the test farm slaves
tests_abirules Launch the abirules tests
               (Warning : for some of the tests, the file make.log
                must be present in the top directory. This means one has
                to compile with the command   make > make.log 2>&1 )
tests_buildsys Launch the buildsys tests
tests_in       Launch several small tests (3 mandatory ones, for basic 
               capabilities of ABINIT, and 4 optional, to test
               bigdft, etsf_io, libxc, wannier90, if they are installed)

One should check whether the following keywords still work :
benchabinit
tests_bench    Test accuracy+cpu for benchmarks (with a report)
tests_speed    Test cpu for benchmarks (quick, with a report)
