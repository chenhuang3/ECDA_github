  #It performs the integration of the calculated forces over  5
  # random displacement (in the range [", -dx, ",",dx,"] a.u.)
  # and compares the result with the difference of the energy
  # between the final and the initial position: E2-E1 = -Integral F.dR"
  # The advantage is two fold:
  # 1) avoiding cancellation error in finite difference derivative,
  # 2) considering the forces over all atoms.

 <BigDFT> log of the run will be written in logfile: ./log.yaml

 Check correctness of forces
 Difference of total energies =  1.84145040746130917E-003
